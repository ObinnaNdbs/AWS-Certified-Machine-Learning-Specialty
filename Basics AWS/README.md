# Section 1 ‚Äì AWS Basics

This section includes fundamental AWS knowledge required as a prerequisite for building ML pipelines in the cloud. These basics do not fall directly under data engineering, modeling, or ML operations but are essential for setting up and understanding AWS infrastructure.

## üß† What‚Äôs Included

### Core AWS Concepts
- **IAM**: Users, roles, policies, groups, and access management
- **Regions & Availability Zones**: Understanding AWS‚Äôs global infrastructure
- **Billing & Cost Management**: Setting up budgets, alarms, and pricing estimates
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Security boundaries and responsibilities
- **Console & CLI Navigation**: Hands-on configuration using both the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI

### Services Overview
- **EC2 Basics**: Launching and terminating instances, AMIs, security groups
- **EBS, S3, EFS, FSx**: Overview of storage types and when to use each
- **VPC Basics**: Subnets, route tables, gateways (without deep networking config)
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring basics and setting up simple alarms

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- `labs/`: Contains hands-on lab implementations (e.g., launching EC2, setting IAM policies)
- `hands_on_notes/`: All lecture-based content done interactively on AWS ‚Äì annotated notes, screenshots, or CLI walkthroughs
- `README.md`: This file

## ‚úÖ Outcomes

By completing this section, I became familiar with:
- AWS infrastructure essentials
- The interface and key navigation patterns of AWS Console
- Basic security and cost-monitoring mechanisms
- Skills necessary to support advanced ML workflows later in the pipeline

This section set up my AWS environment and permissions securely, ensuring I could continue to deploy more advanced machine learning services with confidence.
