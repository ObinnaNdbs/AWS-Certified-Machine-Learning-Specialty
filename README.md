# AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty

This repository contains all of my projects, hands-on labs, notebooks, and tools used while preparing for the **AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty (MLS-C01)** exam. It maps directly to the four exam domains, with a focus on **SageMaker**, **data engineering**, **model tuning**, **MLOps**, and **generative AI**.
