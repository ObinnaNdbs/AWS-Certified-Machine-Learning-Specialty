# ðŸ“Š SageMaker Data Wrangler Lab â€“ Hotel Booking Dataset

This lab demonstrates the use of **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler** for preparing and transforming a dataset for machine learning workflows. We explored basic feature analysis, data quality inspection, visualizations, and applied common data transformations using the **Hotel Booking Demand Dataset** (from Kaggle).

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Amazon S3** â€“ For storing and importing the dataset
- **Amazon SageMaker Studio** â€“ Main interface for launching Data Wrangler
- **SageMaker Data Wrangler** â€“ For preprocessing, analysis, and feature engineering

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Hotel Booking Demand (CSV format)
- **Target Column**: `is_canceled` (binary classification: 0 = not canceled, 1 = canceled)

---

## âœ… Steps Performed

### 1. Data Import & Setup
- Uploaded dataset to S3 under a new folder `bookings`
- Created a new Data Wrangler flow named `bookings`
- Imported the dataset using the first 50,000 rows as a sample

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- **Data preview and type detection**
- **Data Quality and Insights Report**:
  - Detected 30% duplicate rows
  - Detected **target leakage** from columns like `reservation_status`
  - Evaluated class balance in the target variable
  - Reviewed anomalous samples and feature importance

### 3. Data Visualizations
- Created a **histogram** for `is_canceled`
- Created a **scatter plot** between `lead_time` and `ADR`
- Ran a **duplicate rows analysis** to quantify data repetition

### 4. Data Transformations
- ðŸ§¹ **Dropped duplicate rows**
- ðŸ§® **Handled missing values**: Filled missing values in `children` with 0
- ðŸš« **Detected outliers** in `lead_time` using Â±4 standard deviations

## ðŸ§¼ Resource Cleanup
- Shut down SageMaker Studio kernel
- Deleted the SageMaker domain and associated user profile to prevent ongoing charges
